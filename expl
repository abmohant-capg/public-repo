Architecture Explanation
Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
Each tenant's application interacts with a central Azure Function for orchestration. Documents and files from different tenants are stored in container-per-tenant fashion within the same Azure storage account, ensuring logical isolation and easier access management.

Extraction and Indexing Flow
The Azure Function coordinates ingestion and triggers Document Intelligence for extraction. Results are sent to Azure AI Search, creating a distinct index per tenant. Once the search task is complete, a function or logic deletes the search index for proper lifecycle management.

Context Enrichment and Generative AI
For extraction steps requiring advanced LLMs (e.g., fact synthesis), Azure API Management serves as a scalable facade, routing and throttling traffic transparently to multiple OpenAI endpoints behind it. This ensures horizontal scalability and secure, consistent API access for all tenants.

Scalable & Secure Design
Document Intelligence can be scaled with multiple instances or containers.

APIM and OpenAI endpoints scale independently and can enforce quotas per tenant for robust operations.

Deleting search indexes ensures resource lifecycle control and tenant data privacy.

This pattern enables a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflow for multi-tenant applications, supporting efficient scaling, cost optimization, and high security for enterprise AI deployments on Azure.
